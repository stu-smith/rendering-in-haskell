# Rendering in Haskell

Experiments in 3d rendering in Haskell

Each experiment adds further features to the one before. The idea is to be able to diff consecutive experiments to see what has changed. (So, each experiment starts as a copy-paste of the previous).


## Experiment 01

*Basic image generation*

Ensuring that we can write an image. Red component increases along the x-axis, green component increases along the y-axis.

## Experiment 01

*Flat shading*

Rendering the Cornell box using flat shading. Shows basic ray-casting and nothing else.
